# Face and License Plate Recognition System

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Face and License Plate Recognition System** project! This repository contains the code and documentation for a robust security solution designed to enhance safety and security in workplaces and residential areas. By leveraging face recognition and license plate detection technologies, this system offers a seamless and automated method for verifying and controlling access to secured premises.

## Overview

The **Face and License Plate Recognition System** is built using Python, Django, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino. The system integrates face recognition and license plate recognition to verify individuals and vehicles before granting access. Upon successful verification, the system uses servo motors to open the gate, ensuring only authorized personnel and vehicles can enter the premises.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Uses advanced algorithms to recognize and verify authorized personnel.
- **License Plate Recognition**: Detects and verifies vehicle license plates.
- **Automated Gate Control**: Opens the gate using servo motors upon successful verification.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides real-time monitoring and logging of entry and exit events.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Designed to be easily scalable and adaptable to various security needs.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: For scripting and developing the core functionalities.
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for building the backend.
- **OpenCV**: For face and license plate recognition.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Serves as the central processing unit for the system.
- **Arduino**: Controls the servo motors to open the gate.
- **Servo Motors**: Mechanically operate the gate.

## System Architecture

## How It Works

1. **Face Recognition**:
   - Capture and process the face image.
   - Compare the captured image with stored profiles.
   - Authenticate the individual based on recognition results.

2. **License Plate Recognition**:
   - Capture the vehicle's license plate image.
   - Process and recognize the license plate number.
   - Authenticate the vehicle based on recognition results.

3. **Gate Control**:
   - Upon successful face and license plate verification, send a signal to the Arduino.
   - The Arduino activates the servo motors to open the gate.
   - Log the entry/exit event in the system.
